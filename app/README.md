# README

WIP Skeleton to set up quick and dirty progessive web apps (PWA).

Uses Typescript, React and MUI.

## Usage

Stuff you should probably change after cloning:

1. `public/manifest.json` describes various things about your "app"
2. `package.json` defines your public_url, used for routing stuff and when building (also used for github pages, if you host there)
3. `public/index.html` title, favicon, descriptions etc.

## TODO

templateify
